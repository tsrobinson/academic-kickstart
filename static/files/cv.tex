 % \begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{0.5cm}

\item \href{https://doi.org/10.33774/apsa-2020-3tk40-v3}{``Applying the MIDAS Touch: How to Handle Missing Values in Large and Complex Data."} With Ranjit Lall.
% \begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{0.5cm}
%  \textit{We present a new method of multiple imputation using denoising autoencoder neural networks with dropout. MIDAS is highly accurate, scales to long and wide datasets, and can learn dependencies in the data without prior specification.} \\

% \begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{0.5cm}
%  \textit{We provide evidence for a new unexplored mechanism for ballot order effects, in which campaigns themselves adjust their behavior based on their randomly assigned ballot position.} \\

% \begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{0.5cm}
%  \textit{I use a series of conjoint survey experiments on US respondents to show that the effects of disclosure are negligible in the presence of partisan and ideological cues. This is the first paper to test the effects of disclosure across direct democratic and representative institutions.}

\item \href{https://ts-robinson.com/publication/robinson-directdemocracyrepresentative-2020/robinson-directdemocracyrepresentative-2020.pdf}{``Direct democracy in representative systems: Understanding breakdowns in responsiveness through ballot initiative success."} 
% \begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{0.5cm}
%  \textit{Why do ballot initiatives succeed in representative democratic systems? I test a series of theories using precinct-level voter returns, individual-level estimates of donors' ideology, and qualitative evidence from state legislators. I argue that initiatives typically succeed when issues have not been incorporated into the political mainstream.}  \\

% \begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{0.5cm}
%  \textit{Despite their ubiquity in analyses with group-constant variables, the rationale for using standard errors in experimental contexts remains underdeveloped. I show when and why experimentalists should use cluster-robust standard errors, and replicate existing studies to demonstrate the importance of correctly doing so.} \\

\item ``Gender Differences and Development? A Non-Parametric Bayesian Perspective.'' With Raymond Duch and Luke Keele. 
% \begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{0.5cm}
% \textit{We use machine learning to re-examine differences in economic behaviour between men and women from a global survey of preferences. We argue that in contexts where preferences are likely to be highly heterogeneous, researchers need to pay close attention to the functional form of their models.} \\

\item Power analysis for experimental designs.  With Raymond Duch.
% \begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{0.5cm}
