% \begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{0.5cm}
%  \textit{I use a series of conjoint survey experiments on US respondents to show that the effects of disclosure are negligible in the presence of partisan and ideological cues. This is the first paper to test the effects of disclosure across direct democratic and representative institutions.}

% \begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{0.5cm}
%  \textit{Why do ballot initiatives succeed in representative democratic systems? I test a series of theories using precinct-level voter returns, individual-level estimates of donors' ideology, and qualitative evidence from state legislators. I argue that initiatives typically succeed when issues have not been incorporated into the political mainstream.}  \\

% \begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{0.5cm}
%  \textit{Despite their ubiquity in analyses with group-constant variables, the rationale for using standard errors in experimental contexts remains underdeveloped. I show when and why experimentalists should use cluster-robust standard errors, and replicate existing studies to demonstrate the importance of correctly doing so.} \\
