I hesitate to say that lockdown has given me *more* time to read but the slower pace of recent weekends, and fewer alternatives/distractions, mean I've been able to get through more books since March.

I've tried to mix up the various different genres I enjoy -- from the ['New Vanguard'](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/books/vanguard-books-by-women-in-21st-century.html) of women writers to historical fiction and science fiction. In what follows I give my brief thoughts on the books I've read, and the wider issues they've raised.

---

**The Western Wind, Samantha Harvey -- 3/5**
Interesting world and main character, but the plot was a little uninspired. The revelations at the end of what was essentially a dark ages whodunnit were underwhelming nor did they feel 100% coherent.

**Exhalation, Ted Chiang -- 4/5**
Some really excellent, immersive short stories (the opening story about one-way time-travelling windows, another about sentient digital pets), some that were good but not amazing (an archaeological story about Creationism), and others that missed the mark (about a mechanical nurse). The collection was an interesting read, and it was the first time I've read a curated set of short stories, but I wasn’t blown away.

**Now we shall be entirely free, Andrew Miller -- 4.5/5**
Immersive historical fiction, with excellent pacing. I liked that the chase was the most important part of the novel and Miller's use of clever pairings of characters (a deaf man falls for a blind woman). It avoided the cliches of a romance, and the 19th century setting felt particularly vivid. I found the beginning a bit slow and felt out of place compared to the rest of the book, but the rest more than made up for it.

**Conversations with Friends, Sally Rooney -- 4/5**
I really like Rooney's style, and how she documents the mundane aspects of life — similar to other contemporary novels like Lisa Halliday's *Asymmetry* or Rachel Cusk’s *Outline*, that are much more about the emotional story than the 'physical' plot. I found that Frances was so introspective that the fact she didn’t question her own intelligence and position a little jarring. Someone that sensitive to their own self would surely be more critical of their own convictions. This could be deliberate, but I'm not so sure -- I think in general Rooney puts a lot of weight on intelligence as separable and almost distinct from one's emotions and character.

**Ten Thousand Doors of January, Alix E. Harrow -- 4/5**
Nice coming-of-age story, and I really enjoyed the turn-of-the-century backdrop. The 'power of words’ device was good but not entirely convincing, and I think for a book that emphasises the academic pursuit, it might have presented more specifics on the magic behind these doors. I did think that the settings, particularly Nin and Yule Ian’s world was done very well.

**A Different Drummer, William Melvin Kelley --  5/5**
Exactly the kind of book I like. It had the slight pastoral element that reminded me of William Faulkner, but also elements of Paul Auster too — particularly when he turns to Dewey Willson and his father. I thought that the way he weaved the physical movements of the different characters was really clever. The final chapter — going back to the child Mister Leland -- was shocking; it managed to capture the innocence of children contrasted with the brutality of Southern racism, but also how that child might grow up unwittingly to become part of the racist institution.

**God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy -- 5/5**
Really excellent. I found it hard to get into at first, but probably because the style is very different to the books I’d read immediately before. The book is a tragedy, and you spend a lot of time trying to work out how the foreshadowed pivotal event plays out. There is a moment near the end where it clicks, and it was satisfyingly different from what I expected.  I like how Roy used the similes and wordplay of children, and captured how the dark events would appear to a child. The jumbling of time periods worked well. Unlike *A Different Drummer* where the physical paths of the actors criss-cross, here it is the events of multiple time periods that cross, with Roy weaving tragedies that play out across multiple generations of the same (almost cursed) family.

**Circe, Madeline Miller -- 4/5**
Very enjoyable and stitched together both Greek myths I was aware of (Theseus and the Minotaur, Daedalus and Icarus, the Odyssey) with other parts of Greek mythology that I was much less aware of (birth of the Minotaur, creation of Scylla, end of Odyseus’ life). It was a nice contrast to Song of Achilles, whose story is very active and about a physical journey. That said, at times the static nature of the book’s location made the stories a little piecemeal. I really enjoyed the final few chapters, and the portrayal of motherhood was really moving. I also thought the emphasis Miller places on Circe being both immortal and far less powerful than others in her world, was quite compelling.

**Unsheltered, Barbara Kingsolver -- 5/5**
Brutally depressing, particularly at the beginning, and a little close for comfort in terms of how it charts the trials and tribulations of an academic careers! I like how the central themes of the book revealed themselves slowly -- the environmental and anti-capitalist narrative develops as the novel progresses. I enjoyed alternating between time periods (unsurprisingly) and the parallels were really clever. The linking words (some phrase in the last paragraph of one chapter became the title of the next) felt a little unncessary, but overall I thought this book was excellent.

**Silence of the Girls, Pat Barker -- 4.5/5**
Enjoyed this cover to cover -- unlike Miller's retelling of the Illiad, there's no magical realism at play here. Barker's treatment of the death of Patroclus was particularly good, and the ending was very powerful. The first chapter was particularly compelling, and the frankness of Briseis (and the other captured women) was refreshing. Despite the horrors and their treatment, Barker makes this a story of defiance even if in ways that on the face of it seem like defeat (hence the name I guess).

**Index of Self-Destructive Acts, Christopher Beha  --  2/5**
I just never got into this book. I was hoping it would be Auster-like in its setting, but both the story and the writing style felt thin and uninteresting. The group of wealthy/famous individuals who fall from grace are not only unlikeable (which would be fine), but also a bit boring. At times I did find myself being drawn in, but more of the time the book felt like an airport novel. The baseball link was underdone, the discussion of statistics and rational action weak, and the story just seemed to sputter on.

**Everything Under, Daisy Johnson -- 4/5**
Can see why this is part of the new vanguard of fiction writing. The tone is very sombre, and it was almost tiring (in a good way) to read the main character Gretel addreess her mother directly. The Oedipus retelling was clever, though I found the Bonak a little too confusing at times -- I'm not sure I fully got the killing scene near the end.

**A Drop of Patience, William Melvin Kelley -- 5/5**
A more straightforward, linear story than *A Different Drummer* but I found it very powerful. Some of the same ideas come through here -- whether a blacks should cater for whites (in this case as consumers of music), the awkwardness of liberal whites, and what drives people's ambitions. I found Ludlow a compelling character -- he is really flawed, and Kelley cleverly distinguishes between the character's genuine inner monologue and his speech as a way of highlighting these imperfections.

*In general, what I've learned is that the landscapes and physical spaces that the stories occupy are what stick with me. I can instantly feel the parched, dusty fields of *A Different Drummer* or the uncomfortable, uneasy feel of Frances' flat in *Conversations with Friends*. And while both Kerala (*The God of Small Things*) and the island of Aeaea (*Circe*) are lush settings, they have almost completely opposite emotional effects given the stories that take place within them. Whereas the dense wildlife of Circe's home grant her freedom and power, the rubber plants and foliage of Ayemenem are claustrophobic, choking the lives (and fates) of the children. How characters move about, interact, and think in these spaces is really important -- and I guess this feels even more poignant given how static everyday (real) life is currently.*
