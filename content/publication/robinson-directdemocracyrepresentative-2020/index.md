abstract: Policy referendums around the world succeed regularly and on important policy
  areas. But why do these policies pass by direct democracy and not through the legislature?
  In this paper, I address this puzzle by focussing on ballot initiative success in
  the United States. Using a combination of district level voting data, ideological
  estimates of campaign donors, and a small survey of state legislators, I test why
  state policy is incongruent with citizens’ preferences and thus why direct democracy
  succeeds. Taken together, my results suggest that initiatives are used to pass popular
  policy when the issue has not taken root in the mainstream policy community. Moderate
  correlations between partisan and initiative voting suggest that initiative issues
  are not fully captured by the partisan dimension of conﬂict. Many initiatives, but
  not all, moderate away from the position of the majority party and towards the minority
  party. And evidence from campaign ﬁnance data suggests successful initiative campaigns
  attract more ideologically extreme donors than do successful legislative candidates
  in the same cycle. Finally, I present qualitative survey evidence to show that legislators
  are aware of the responsiveness gap and their own aversion to passing certain popular
  policies.
