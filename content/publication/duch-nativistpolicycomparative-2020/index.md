abstract: Firms in the USA rely on highly skilled immigrants, particularly in the
  science and engineering sectors. Yet, the recent politics of immigration marks a
  substantial change to US immigration policy. We implement a conjoint experiment
  that isolates the causal effect of nativist, anti-immigrant, pronouncements on where
  skilled potential-migrants choose to immigrate to. While these policies have a significantly
  negative effect on the destination choices of Chilean and UK student subjects, they
  have little effect on the choices of Indian and Chinese student subjects. These
  results are confirmed through an unobtrusive test of subjectsâ€™ general immigration
  destination preferences. Moreover, there is some evidence that the negative effect
  of these nativist policies are particularly salient for those who self-identify
  with the Left.
