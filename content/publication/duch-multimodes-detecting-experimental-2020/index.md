abstract: 'Experiments should be designed to facilitate the detection of experimental
  measurement error. To this end, we advocate the implementation of identical experimental
  protocols employing diverse experimental modes. We suggest iterative nonparametric
  estimation techniques for assessing the magnitude of heterogeneous treatment e ects
  across these modes. And we propose two diagnostic strategies—measurement metrics
  embedded in experiments, and measurement experiments—that help assess whether any
  observed heterogeneity reflects experimental measurement error. To illustrate our
  argument, first we conduct and analyze results from four identical interactive experiments:
  in the lab; online with subjects from the CESS lab subject pool; online with an
  online subject pool; and online with MTurk workers. Second, we implement a measurement
  experiment in India with CESS Online subjects and MTurk workers.'
