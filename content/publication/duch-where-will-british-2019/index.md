abstract: Objective Immigration is a highly salient political issue. We examine the
  migration preferences of potential emigrants from the United Kingdom to determine
  whether the migration calculus is primarily economic or political. Methods A conjoint
  survey experiment was conducted with U.K. subjects drawn from the CESS, Nuffield
  College, Oxford University, student subject pool to identify causal drivers of emigration
  preferences. Results Logit estimation of emigration preferences indicates that economics
  and politics matters. Anti-immigrant rhetoric, “Trumpian policies,” and the United
  States deter high-skilled U.K. potential emigrants; economic growth, education,
  and social benefits attract them. Politics and social benefits are more important
  for those on the political left, while economics and education weigh more heavily
  for those on the right. Conclusion What will attract the highly skilled migrants
  from a post-Brexit United Kingdom? Economics matters of course but for many of these
  potential emigrants politics is important—they are particularly sensitive to anti-immigrant
  rhetoric.
