abstract: When researchers suspect that error terms are correlated by group in observational
  research the standard correction is to cluster the standard errors. But what about
  in experimental contexts where treatment is randomised? Despite their ubiquity in
  analyses with group-constant variables, the rationale for using clustered standard
  errors in experimental contexts remains underdeveloped. In this paper I present
  an intuitive and applied explanation of when clustering is appropriate, building
  on recent contributions in the statistics and econometrics literatures. I demonstrate
  why randomisation does not lead to identical variance estimates across estimation
  strategies, and conduct a review of experimental studies published between 2017
  and 2019 to show that these diï¬€erences can be considerable. Finally, I provide practical
  guidance for when and why to cluster standard errors for common experimental designs.
