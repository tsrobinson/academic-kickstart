 abstract = {Information about how campaigns are financed is abundant in the United States, but we have only scratched the surface of how these disclosures affect voter behaviour. For instance, how big an impact does a campaign's financial profile have on vote choice itself? How robust is disclosure information to other political signals? And do the effects of disclosure differ across representative and direct democratic elections? I address these questions by implementing a series of conjoint experiments on hypothetical gubernatorial and ballot initiative races. For candidate elections, I also randomize whether subjects are exposed to additional political signals. I find that while subjects can use a candidate's financial profile to influence their vote choice, these effects will be ``swamped'' by explicit partisan signals. In ballot initiative contexts, similarly, the evidence suggests explicit policy information drowns out disclosure signals.},
