abstract: 'How does the public want a COVID-19 vaccine to be allocated? We conducted
  a conjoint experiment asking 15,536 adults in 13 countries to evaluate 248,576 profiles
  of potential vaccine recipients that varied randomly on five attributes. Our sample
  includes diverse countries from all continents. The results suggest that in addition
  to giving priority to health workers and to those at high risk, the public favours
  giving priority to a broad range of key workers and to those on lower incomes. These
  preferences are similar across respondents of different education levels, incomes,
  and political ideologies, as well as across most surveyed countries. The public
  favoured COVID-19 vaccines being allocated solely via government programs, but were
  highly polarized in some developed countries on whether taking a vaccine should
  be mandatory. There is a consensus among the public on many aspects of COVID-19
  vaccination which needs to be taken into account when developing and communicating
  roll-out strategies.'
