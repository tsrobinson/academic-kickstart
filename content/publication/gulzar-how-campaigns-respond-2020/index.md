abstract: 'An established finding on ballot design is that prominent positions on
  the ballot improves the electoral performance of parties or candidates because voters
  respond behaviorally to salient information. This paper presents evidence on an
  additional unexplored mechanism: campaigns, who act before voters, adjust their
  behavior when allocated a salient position on the ballot. We use a constituency-level
  lottery of ballot positions in Colombia and first establish that a ballot-order
  effect exists: campaigns randomly placed at the top earn more votes and seat shares.
  Second, we show that campaigns react to being placed on top of the ballot: they
  raise and spend more money on their campaign and spending is correlated with higher
  vote shares. In addition to presenting evidence for how campaigns react strategically
  to election administration, our results provide the first evidence for a new mechanism
  for the ballot-order effects examined in many previous studies.'
