I am an Assistant Professor in Quantitative Comparative Politics at the [School of Government and International Affairs](https://www.dur.ac.uk/sgia/), Durham University. I am also affiliated with the [Centre for Experimental Social Science (CESS)](https://cess-nuffield.nuff.ox.ac.uk/) at Nuffield College, University of Oxford, and am currently a [research collaborator](https://research.fb.com/) onsite with Facebook's Statistics and Privacy team.

My research interests surround money in politics, democratic representation and voter behaviour, as well as methodological issues within experimental and computational social science. 

I successfully defended my DPhil in Politics at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk) in July 2020. During my graduate studies I held a joint ESRC-Wadham RCUK studentship, and was a Quantitative Methods scholar at the [Department of Politics and International Relations](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford.
